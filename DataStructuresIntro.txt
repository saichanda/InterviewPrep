Data structure is a way of storing data in the computer that optimizes in terms of time and space complexities.
Important datastructures are Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues

Array stores homogeneous data at the contiguous locations, where size of an array needs to be known in advance.
Access Time: O(1) since elements are contiguous
Search Time: O(n) for Sequential Search
             O(log n) for Binary Search
Insertion Time: O(n)
